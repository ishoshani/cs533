Report:
I added the methods for mutexes and condition variables and got them to work with the first test. I am having more trouble on the second.
I think my final thread somewhere is returning in the thread_wrap instead of yielding, but I am not sure how to fix this yet.


Discussion:
1. For the next Assignment, we will need to find some other way to make locks atomic, since with another kernel thread we can
be preempted at any time. We might be able to do this by disabling interrupts.
